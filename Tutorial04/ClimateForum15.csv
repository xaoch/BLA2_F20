Temperature drives [CO2], that is the T rises first and this causes an increase in CO2, but the time scale involved is about a 1000 years.  This correlation is irrelevant as to whether the modern T increase is due in whole or in part to the modern [CO2] increase.

If you're wanting to ask about general topics related to climate science or chat about concepts with fellow students, it would be better to use the General Discussion board, which has been set up as just such a space.Before you post a question here, you should try a couple of things first: - For technical issues, first check your computer to make sure it isn't a problem with your computer or internet, - Then check the edX help button located on the left of your screen to see if their information can help you or post your problem with the platform to them directly, - Finally, post here with precise and detailed queries so that we can best help you;For course related questions, be sure to check the course syllabus carefully.Staff will be checking this discussion forum regularly, but please be patient! We can't always reply immediately, especially given the different time zones.In the meantime, you might well find that a fellow student can provide you with an answer, and we encourage you all to read others' posts to help out where you can. You might be surprised how much you can learn from one another!This thread is closed to avoid different issues getting reported as responses. To make us aware of technical issues, please do the following: - Search the forum to check if a fellow student has encountered and mentioned the same issue already. If you are lucky, then a solution has already been posted in the forum and there's no need to create another thread about it. If there is a related thread but no solution yet, feel free to add more information to it. For tracking down technical issues, there's no such thing as too much information! - If you don't find anything relevant yet, start a new thread (or post) in the Troubleshooting forum with these three steps:    - (1) Click on ""New Post"" near the top of the forum page    - (2) Select the ""Troubleshooting"" forum from the TOPIC AREA drop-down    - (3) Add a meaningful title to reflect the issue you encountered![enter image description here][1]Then, describe the issue in as much detail as possible so that it can be reproduced by course staff.*Thanks to Denial101x for permitting us to adapt this content for our course.*  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14449354239949072.png"

I heard that thin clouds are white because they scatter all frequencies of light equally well. But as the clouds get thicker, more and more lights get absorbed by the water droplets and ice crystals. That's why thick clouds are dark. This makes sense to me but it contradicts Dr. Harris' statement of thick clouds are more reflective than thin ones. In the last video of ""Reflection of incoming solar radiation,"" Dr. Harris advanced an intriguing hypothesis of increasing Earth's surface temp keeping the evaporated water in vapor form. The greenhouse effect plus the decreased reflectivity from less cloud formation will further increase Earth's temp. But as water vapor ascends, it will expand due to decreased surrounding atmospheric pressure. The expanding vapor is performing positive work and it will decrease its internal energy thus its temp will drop. Sometimes the drop in temp is so fast that the water vapor is turned into ice with sufficient mass such that even the upsurging warm air can not hold it up and we have hailstorms. What went wrong with my thinking here?"

She would not wish her own life to her worst enemy. A child is conceived. She does not wish a daughter to have the same life as her and hence kills the child as soon as she can determine the sex of the child.

The net result is an amplifying effect on the global temperature mediated by the Greenhouse Effect. Economic success has an amplifying effect on policy maker popularity stock. Global temperature increase causes climate change that is not compatible with civilization as we know it, which has a stabilizing effect on policy maker popularity stock. People start to notice and begin to educate themselves about the science of what's happening; they realize their policy makers are not up to speed on the science of climate change and sustainability. This has a further stabilizing effect on the popularity of policy makers, causing the voter base stock on which the policy makers count in order to keep their jobs to sharply decrease. In response, the policy makers educate themselves, in order to match the concerns of their voters, and start implementing policies that support sustainable business practices (such as using solar energy, instead of coal, to power businesses). This has an amplifying effect on both the popularity stocks of the policy makers, as well as a stabilizing effect on the greenhouse gas stocks in the atmosphere as well as on the forestry stocks.

It's great to see people engaging with the course material and posting feedback loop examples! Thanks to everyone who's posted! We've seen some great examples. It seems that most people are comfortable with the idea of amplifying feedback but some have a little more trouble with stabilizing feedback. Here are a few general comments based on reading through the examples posted so far:1) Remember that feedback loops must loop. In an amplifying feedback, a change in a given quantity must lead to a secondary effect that causes a further change of the original quantity in the same direction. Simple cause and effect relationships or examples where multiple causes independently contribute to the same effect are not feedback loops. Consider the following three examples:  a) John eats unhealthy food, which causes him to gain weight.  b) John eats unhealthy food, which causes him to gain weight. He never exercises because he's too busy, this causes him to gain even more weight. c) John eats unhealthy food at the restaurant next door to his home. Eating the unhealthy food causes him to gain weight. The weight gain makes it harder to ride his bicycle to the grocery store to buy healthy food so he eats more unhealthy food and gains more weight.   Scenario c is an example of a feedback loop but a and b are not. Scenario a is a simple cause and effect relationship. In scenario b, poor diet and lack of exercise both contribute to weight gain but they are independent causes. In scenario c the initial weight gain makes it harder for John to find healthy food, which leads to more fast food, which leads to more weight gain, creating a feedback loop.2) In stabilizing feedbacks, a perturbation of a quantity away from a given value causes an effect that tends to change the quantity back toward its original value. The regulation of the glucose level in the human body is a good example of a stabilizing feedback. High blood glucose levels cause insulin to be secreted by the pancreas. Insulin breaks down glucose and removes it from the blood. When glucose level drop, the pancreas stops receiving the signal to produce insulin, and glucose level stabilizes.That basic concept can be complicated by the fact that the stabilizing effect can be delayed and can cause the original quantity to stabilize at a different value than the one it started at. Let's illustrate that with an example. a) Zara normally leaves work at 5pm. She finds that traffic is really bad at that time of day so one day she decides to leave at 6pm. There's less traffic at six but it's still a bit busy so the next day she leaves at 7pm. She finds that when she leaves at 7pm she doesn't have enough time to spend with her family so she starts leaving at 630pm. This gives her the right balance between reducing her commute and having family time.In this example, bad traffic causes a perturbation in Zara's departure time. Her departure continues to get later until she feels the stabilizing force of wanting to spend time with her family. This causes her to return to the stable value of 630pm.Some examples posted to the discussion forum involved scenarios where some quantity began to change due to some forcing effect and would continue to change until it found a new stable value, at which point it would stop changing. A couple of these examples were missing a stabilizing force. For example, in the above example, if Zara had simply changed her departure time from 5pm to 6pm, decided that was good enough and then set 6pm as her standard departure time, that would not be an example of feedback. There is no stabilizing force, just a stop in the perturbing force, the traffic. Recall once again that a feedback loop must loop. The initial change in a quantity must cause a secondary effect that causes further change in the quantity--in the opposite direction for stabilizing feedback and in the same direction for amplifying feedback.Once again, thanks to everyone who's posted a feedback example! Please reply to this thread if you found any of the above post unclear or confusing.Patrick"

I tried to submit the assignment before the deadline, but couldn't do so- due to the site's technical failure. I am really sorry that I failed to make it. It would have been great if you consider this. Thank you in advance!The assignment looks like this:Sea level rise has numerous impacts on the environment, human populations, and bio-diversity. It is caused by warming atmospheric and oceanic temperature causing polar ice sheets melt and thus adding more water in water bodies, which in turn results in submerging of coastal areas, and flooding. However, the impacts of sea-level rise are not homogenously distributed across different places, of the world. In other words, the impact of sea level rise could be seen in such parameters as immediate, long-term, direct, and indirect. For instance, the impacts are, at the immediate-level, felt particularly around coastal places. In some cases, it threatens the very existence of coastal communities and ecosystems. For example, the Bikini Islands (part of Marshall Islands) has been experiencing dramatic sea-level rise that compelled about 1,000 of the Islanders to apply to relocate to the United States in October, 2015. This is due to huge tides and increasing storms (bbc.co.uk). Kiribati has also been buying land from Fiji, due to sea-level rise that threatened its existence. In fact, more than 100 million people live within 1m distance of current sea-level (www.wheelercentre.com/events/new-dystopias-climate-change-fiction). Conversely, in spite of the increasing number of people that live in sea-level risk situations across the world, many regions, example land locked countries are likely to feel the pressure of sea level rise in indirect and long-term fashions. These regions and countries are likely to experience the impact of sea-level rise as part of the changing global atmospheric temperature. For instance, reduction in food production in some areas, attributed to sea-level rise, may have a direct impact on other areas, particularly those that have previously been dependent on the food production of coastal areas (Leggett, 1990). Whatever the case, in the last 150 or so years, sea levels rose by 20cm. By the end of the century, sea-levels are expected to rise 50-100cm above what they were in the 1990s. Unfortunately, sea-levels will continue to change, even we could manage to control climate change for 100s and even 1000s of years. The most vulnerable regions are Southern cost of z Mediterranean, West Coast of Africa, South Asia, Coastal Areas of Southeast Asia, Low-lying coral atolls of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. About 2 billion people live in these regions and 50% of whom earn less than 2 USD or less a day. Additionally, 655 of the worldâ€™s â€œmega citiesâ€ù are located on low-lying coastal areas, within 10m of sea-levels. â€œBy 2050, 26 major US cities will face an â€œemerging flooding crisis.â€ù Globally, storm damage could cost cities from Hong Kong to Dhaka to New York trillions annually unless adaptation measures are taken.â€ù Population in these regions is growing rapidly: example, in India (80%) and in Indonesia (60%) will be exposed to sea-level rise over the next century (www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/10/scientistsÂ_predictÂ_hugeÂ_seaÂ_levelÂ_riseÂ_evenÂ_ifÂ_weÂ_limitÂ_climateÂ_change 3/3).

Sea level change is caused in great part due to the melting of specific ice sheets which have trapped water (and carbon) for millennia â€“ especially those in  Antarctica which hold enough ice, if all melted, to raise sea levels more than 200 feet (Paolo, Fricker and Padman). Given the magnitude of this, though sea level change will have a global impact, it will be disproportionately felt by poorer nations like Bangladesh in the global south that are heavily agrarian and lack proper planning. Poorer nations are often referred to as the â€œglobal southâ€ù, given many of them are located in the southern hemisphere, though they do not necessarily have to be so. Additionally, they are typified by economies that are based heavily on agriculture and on medium to low human development across factors including infant mortality, healthcare, adequate water and sanitation infrastructure etc.  Many of these countries have lower sea-elevation which makes them more likely to experience flooding and land being reclaimed by the sea due to sea level change. One of the first reasons that poorer nations like Bangladesh will be hit harder by sea level change is due to their economy type. Many of these nations are primarily agrarian, relying directly on agriculture for not only sustenance but also for any secondary income used for other purchases or exchanges in a barter type system. With sea level changes expected to put much fertile land underwater, many of these people will have their livelihoods destroyed and will be forced to move to urban centers with poorer sanitation and living infrastructure. In Bangladesh for instance, 40% of productive land is projected to be lost in the southern region of Bangladesh for a 65cm sea level rise by the 2080s (Bisset). Secondly, sea level change is projected to have a disproportionate impact on poorer nations due to improper planning / man-made interventions. Bangladesh experiences flooding and other devastating natural disasters frequently due to its lower than sea level elevation. In part due to this, they have engaged in government and private sector led embankment build projects throughout the coast of the country, especially in areas that are particularly devastated by the flooding, like the island portions of the nation called polders. These man made embankments, unfortunately, have the secondary effect of diverting the natural flow of sediment that up until then were helping increase the elevation of several of the islands (Friedman). Additionally, these embankments are associated with poor drainage and other problems. These manmade contributions to sea level rise should not discount the effect of sea level change that is driven purely by global climate change, but should instead be a reminder that we must be careful and deliberate with our responses to these phenomena. Overall, due to a host of factors, including lower elevation, economies that are based heavily on agriculture and, improper manmade interventions poorer nations in the Global South are expected to feel the effects of sea level change in a more pronounced way. Attempting to understand, predict and prepare for sea level change is an unfortunate reality that all nations, not just those in the global south, must prepare for. Many poorer nations, like Bangladesh, are taking a leadership role in this regard, moving the global climate change agenda forward (Bisset). The effect of sea level change, along with the others due to global climate change are those in which we cannot afford to be underprepared. **References**Bisset, Robert.

The heating up  of the the Caribbean Sea due to global warming has been responsible for many natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and storms. For example in 2014, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia and Dominica were affected by hurricanes which resulted in the deaths of many Caribbean Nationals. In 2015 Dominica was again devastated by a flood which was due to the impact of climate change on the environment. Most of the Caribbean countries including Trinidad and Tobago are heavily reliant on  tourism, agriculture and fishing to generate their economies and as such the impact of natural disasters due to global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer have significant consequences for many of these small island developing countries. (IDB 2013)The government of Trinidad and Tobago in particular became signatory to the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention on Climate Change and has undertaken obligations to reduce the levels of CFCs in the atmosphere which contribute to the greenhouse gas effect. It has in particular placed a ban on aerosol products containing CFCs in order to reduce the impact of greenhouse gases. However because Trinidad and Tobago is an energy based economy there is a need to reduce the level of toxic emissions released into the atmosphere due to natural gases.  It is also a worrying concern that there are too many persons on the roads  driving motor vehicles which contribute to the greenhouse gas effect as there are several households in Trinidad and Tobago that have more than two motor vehicles per household due to the used car industry.  This factor has not only contributed to congestion on the roads but has resulted in the increase in toxic emissions into the atomosphere.The government of Trinidad and Tobago and the developing countries of the Caribbean region may need to create a policy like Canada and the Netherlands to encourage persons to use bicycles as an alternative mode of transport  as this may be a viable means of reducing the level of CFCs into the atmosphere.References:Inter-American Development Bank (2013).

I do not know, maybe we can paint everything white o put mirrors in the ceilings while we found a way to break a CO2 molecule and use the carbon without releasing it to the atmosphere and leave O2 free in the air. Maybe we can find out other energy sources; maybe all countries should start thinking in a efficient way to generated electricity as nuclear plants, without fire atomic bombs to each other; we maybe should star using just public transportation and that should be running with electricity.

It launched me onto a path of discovery; It pushed me into updating my maths, physics and chemistry in order to answer those nagging questions: how, why etc. Then I got rather lost in the enormity of the subject.Suddenly, this course appeared, and it has brought together all the myriad aspects of my learning to date. I still can't decide if I'm more fascinated by paleo-climatology, oceanography, the atmosphere or the cryosphere, but I do know that now I'll continue studying.I loved the model simulators - even when I'd managed to save the world but knew that in reality it wouldn't happen. The extra readings gave me some great links and were very useful and interesting, particularly the UCL online text book.Sara Harris is now one of my favourite climate scientists (the other one being Kevin Anderson). So a huge thank you for re-doing this course.(ps: the Denial course was rubbish!)"

I came across an article about ocean dead zones (lack of dissolved oxygen due to flushing nitrates into the oceans). Now, my gut tells me that there must be a link to the carbon cycle: CO+HO=CH2O +O2.So, if there's a lack of 02 there must also be a lack of carbon; which must mean that either the CO2 uptake in these areas is reduced or it's being vented back out.So, any links to papers that go into this please?"

So, I guess I'll be penalized for my extra work. I could have edited it down to fit the given word count, but it wouldn't even to begin explaining the amount of pollution in my area, or how my small island is able to consume and restore toxic gasses into helpful gasses in our atmosphere.So, I hope at least a few of you will find my little location index, on Galveston Island, on the bottom of Texas on the Gulf of Mexico, and will click on my name and read my essay. If you do that -- and learn just a little more about the hazards of petrochemical refineries in our atmosphere -- and discover how the ecosystems of barrier islands and off-shore undersea forests of seagrass can help restore a devastating amount of toxic pollution that these refineries are pouring into our atmosphere. Then I think the deduction of a few points on this survey well deserves the deduction. I'll give up 10 or 12 points if my essay can help educate others. I'm doing this to better educate myself on climate change, and how climate change is affecting our island and how climate change will affect out island in the future as our two girls (age 4 and 5) will grow up here, and will hopefully share my concerns for the planet and our local ecosystems in particular.So, with that in mind, if I lose points, or fail the course, it doesn't matter to me I've discovered a wealth of information about my island and I got the opportunity to share that with others interested in the effects of climate change on our planet. And now I know different non-profit organizations I can work with, or volunteer for to help maintain our local ecosystem and do the very best to be stewards of our land and the ecosystems that it supports."

It was also helpful, through the rubric instructions, in improving writing.The staff responded immediately to every question, doubt, and even complaint although they are part of a university staff (something very demanding both in time and effort). Therefore, congratulation is very little. So, I would like to express my gratitude to the staff for this course with the wish that someday they provide another course - a next level of the current (please do notify me in such a case).I would also like to thank my â€œco-studentsâ€ù in this course for their interesting posts and their peer reviewing.Irini"

There is a TV Show on Discovery Channel called Racing Extinction which premiered yesterday. And it is a 2015 production. The first half hour of it does talk about animal extinction. But in the second half hour they are talking about the effects of climate change. How the oceans are absorbing carbon and how it's turning them more acidic which then jeopardizes shell based marine life. They also discuss methane from cattle and permafrost melt. They lit methane into a flame on top of water to prove it was there.They just did a part where they used special filters on cameras which made carbon emissions visible. They drove around and you could see the carbon pouring from cars and buildings and even people's breath.Another part showed that plankton generates oxygen. But plankton are vulnerable to the changes in the ocean from climate change. If we lose that source of oxygen it could have serious impacts.I haven't seen the end of the show yet. I wanted to hop on here and say if you are somewhere in the world that has access to the Discovery channel you might want to watch this show.

Even if the global mean surface temperature trend has flattened during the 2000 - 2013 period compared to the clearly increasing trend in previous years, it still is considered to be increasing, just not as fast as in the previous decades.  Those that ""believe"" may acknowledge that the rate of temperature increase during these more recent years is not as rapid as during earlier years, however most every other indicator continues to reflect a warming world (e.g., most glaciers are shrinking, arctic ice extent shows a decreasing trend, the temperature of the upper ocean layers are increasing, every year continues to be statistically warmer than the year before, etc).  Taken together, those parameters don't represent a ""hiatus"".  On the other hand, the ""deniers"" point to the graphs with a selected starting year (typically 1998), which appear to the eye to be a relatively flat trend of surface temperatures.  And since CO2 levels have continued to rise, and since  surface temperatures are not rising as much as models had predicted based on rising CO2 levels, some conclude that we're seeing a ""hiatus"", calling into question the models and science.  It seems to be a political or ideological argument, and I don't believe it will be resolved in the short term.  Believers in the science will explain the data and explain how, when everything is taken together, the data clearly shows that the world is warming, and it cannot be tied to natural causes.  Opponents of climate change tend to ignore the collective evidence, but instead point out individual specific data points which are inconclusive or appear to negate the overall trends (a few specific glaciers are not shrinking, ice extent in Antarctica is expanding, satellite records at a specific level of the stratosphere aren't behaving as predicted, climate in one particular region of a State, Country, or region is cooling over a selected time period, etc).   Studies showing those individual anomalies continue to be published, so I think we'll have to wait for the year 2025 or 2030 and then see which group gets to say ""I told you so"".  "

For me the benefits of electric cars are far outweighed at the moment by the negative aspects of electricity generation. However, once the State of California solves our electricity storage problem (reference to Tesla!) then I would be 100% for the universal use of electric cars.As for me: retired old lady!

You're correct that the graph starts with a ""normal"" summer temperature distribution for the years 1951 to 1980.  That's the baseline for comparison.  So the gray band in the middle shows that the preponderance of days for those years, by definition, fits in the ""normal"" range.  Then the video proceeds and looks at ten year spans moving forward.  What it shows by the 2:39 mark is what ""the new normal"" looks like for the years between 2001 to 2011.  The summer temperatures have been creeping up toward the hotter range.  The gray band labeled 2001/2011 is much smaller than the original gray band from the starting point, e.g., the years from 1951 to 1980.  So let's say for the location, during the 12 weeks of summer during 1951 to 1980, the average daily temperature was 25C.  For the purpose of illustration, let's say that 25% of the days were at 25C.  So that's ""normal"",  Let's then say that 20% of the days were a little cooler than normal at 22C, 15% of the days were cool at 19C, 2.5% of the days were cold at 16C.  Similarly, let's assume that 20% of the days were a little warmer than normal at 28C, and 15% of the days were hot at 31C and 2.5% of the days were abnormally hot at 34C.  Plotting these days in a normal distribution gives you that approximation of a bell-curve.  Moving forward to 2001/2011, assume the new summer average temperature is now 27C.  If the distribution is similar to the 1951 to 1980 bell curve, it's shape is the same, but shifted toward the warm side.  So the number of days that fall into the ""average"" for the 1951 to 1980 years is now smaller than before.  I'm sure I didn't do a very good job of trying to explain the graph, but I hope that helps.         "

Some remote and uninhabited regions may not have weather stations, but for the most part, good temperature inputs are obtainable from all over the world, and are used to report ""average temperature"" of the planet.  Note that while it's not impossible that some specific localities may actually see a cooling trend over a year (or more), that doesn't negate the overall world-wide average temperature trend.  The overall average temperatures as measured across the world, over the course of the year, are reportedly showing an increasing trend.  Satellite measurements are now being used too, at least since the late '70s, and they have the ability to provide excellent coverage of the earth as they circle the globe.  Their measurements are of atmospheric temperatures, and are indirect, and take a lot of analysis to interpret as I understand.   I don't believe that these satellite measurements are included in the surface temperatures when calculating ""average temperature"", but I'm pretty sure they show their own specific trends for scientists to review and analyze.

I'm quite sure that during this course we'll be learning how an increase in CO2 will lead to increasing temperatures (the greenhouse effect), e.g., CO2 drives temperature.  However, as you point out, and as the graph seems to indicate, *sometimes* Temperature drives CO2 levels.  This I can understand since the oceans (70% of the surface of the planet?) are huge sinks for carbon dioxide.  Warm oceans hold less CO2, and cool oceans absorb more CO2, so as the planet warms, atmospheric CO2 levels may increase, and if the plant cools, the oceans will absorb more CO2, decreasing atmospheric CO2 levels.  Hence, as you point out, temperature can drive CO2.  So it appears that it cuts both ways, but the relationship is maintained, regardless of what's driving and what's being driven.  At least that's my understanding as we begin week 1 of the course.  But I'm here to learn, and hope to hear more about this.   "

It is the most important parameter used to try and quantify the temperature effects of climate change. It is the expected temperature rise with a doubling of CO2 concentration after a long time to equilibriate.  The effect of changing [CO2] is expected to be logarithmic, so one would expect the delta temperature to be the same for doubling whether it's from 280 to 560 ppm or 400 to 800 ppm or 800 to 1600 ppm. A closely related parameter is  TCR - Transient Climate Response, which is like ECS but over shorter time scales.Estimates of temperature increases, of course, depend not just on ECS but also on delta [CO2].

We know why the temperature might change with this period --- the Milankovitch cycles. There is no reason that [CO2] should have this cycle period other than being driven by T changes.So you can argue that the T increase is likely enhanced by a GHG effect, but you cannot use this data to quantify that unless you had knowledge of how big the delta T would be without increased [CO2]."

For example, ships crossing the oceans have been recording water input temperatures (sea water is used to cool engines), but these temperatures have been affected by the temperature of the ships engines. When this was realised, and the numbers re-crunched, it gave the impression that suddenly the oceans had cooled. They hadn't, but the measurements had!So it's very important to know where the information comes from, and how it was obtained and how the instruments  are calibrated. Similarly, as we change measurement technologies, from tree rings to satellites, this can also alter very slightly the observations. This doesn't mean that we can't trust the information, it just means that our dear scientists are kept constantly on their toes looking for more and more accuracy and precision."

If we take anthropogenic sources out of the picture and hold temperature constant, then there is a dynamic equilibrium of [CO2] among the atmosphere, biosphere and oceans. Geologic processes also contribute. On long time scales rock weathering is a CO2 sink and volcanic eruptions are a CO2 source. On longer time scales, if the temperatures increase, the oceans out gas CO2 and atmospheric [CO2] increases.Now put anthropogenic emissions back in and we see that they represent about 5%(?) of the amount of CO2 over and above the exchanges among air, ocean and biosphere.  Some skeptics have argued that this is too small to worry about, but if it is a steady contribution over and above equilibrium then we could expect to see atmospheric [CO2] rise. That is what is observed. The amount of increase in atmospheric [CO2] is about half the estimated anthropogenic emissions, so this also makes sense given Le ChÃ¢telier's principle, which says that if you stress a system in equilbrium the equilibrium shifts so as to (partially) relieve the stress.Among countries, China is the big leader in [CO2] emissions. Starting about 2004 China went from less than US emissions to parity with the combined emissions of the US+EU+Japan. This rapid increase in anthropogenic emissions of CO2 was unexpectedly NOT followed by a corresponding change in the rate of increase of atmospheric [CO2]. That is puzzling, and at least suggests that a significant fraction of the increasing [CO2] may be natural.This observation was brought to my attention by Murray Salby, who authored one of the leading texts on atmospheric physics. It seems he was unceremoniously fired from his University position for expounding on this topic. See: http://www.city-journal.org/2014/24_3_global-warming.html"

Why do I say that itâ€™s undefined? Because â€œ*catastrophic*â€ù can mean very different things to different people, neither the â€œwhereâ€ù, â€œwhenâ€ù or â€œfor whomâ€ù is clear and the term is rarely - if ever - defined when CAGW gets mentioned.

Unfortunately only 41 of the 11,944 papers Cook reviewed, explicitly make that claim. Cook claimed 64 did, but that is still only 0.5%  To get to 97% he had to use the much weaker definition:    http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-013-9647-9.You are claiming we have to act now to avoid catastrophe.  That is a much stronger claim. Hopefully for you the rest of this course may provide some evidence, but I am doubting it.As to strawman arguments, the Denial101x video you linked to is a classic example. It spends most of its time debunking the idea that volcanoes can be a significant natural CO2 source (at least in modern times).  Some skeptics may make this claim, but it is not mainstream and it certainly is not Salby's argument.FYI - I took the Denial101x course -- well at least most of it, I went on vacation part way through and never got back to it.  By then it was obvious to me that it was going to largely be a waste of time.  I did enjoy Oreskes' diatribe against Frank Luntz for using the term ""climate change"". So much passion for such a trivial point."

Legates et al's interpretation of our study is a gross misrepresentation either due to not understanding what it says or willfully deciding to go with Monckton's laughable reasoning he had posted earlier on WUWT. Here is the relevant section of a [blog post detailing the various ways the consensus gets denied][4]:> **Taking Consensus Denial to the Extreme**> > One critique of the consensus has [been published in a paper in the> journal Science & Education][5].  The argument made in the paper was first> published by [Christopher Monckton on a climate contrarian blog][6]. > Monckton has also suggested [the conspiracy theory][7] that the journal> Environmental Research Letters was created (in 2006) specifically for> the purpose of publishing Cook et al. (2013).> > The Monckton paper takes [the point about quantification above][8] to the> extreme.  It focuses exclusively on the papers that quantified> human-caused global warming, and takes these as a percentage of all> 12,000 abstracts captured in the literature search, thus claiming the> consensus is not 97%, but rather 0.3%.  The logical flaws in this> argument should be obvious, and thus should not have passed through> the peer-review process. > > Approximately two-thirds of abstracts did not take a position on the> causes of global warming, for various reasons (e.g. the causes were> simply not relevant to or a key component of their specific research> paper).  Thus in order to estimate the consensus on human-caused> global warming, it's necessary to focus on the abstracts that actually> stated a position on human-caused global warming.> > When addressing the consensus regarding humans being responsible for> the majority of recent global warming, the same argument holds true> for abstracts that do not quantify the human contribution.  We simply> can't know their position on the issue - that doesn't mean they> endorse or reject the consensus position; they simply don't provide> that information, and thus must first be removed before estimating the> quantified consensus.> > As [noted above][9], when we perform this calculation, the consensus> position that humans are the main cause of global warming is endorsed> in 87% of abstracts and 96% of full papers.  Monckton's argument is> very similar to the myth that CO2 can't cause significant global> warming because it only comprises 0.04% of the atmosphere.  99% of the> atmosphere is comprised of non-greenhouse gases, but these other gases> are irrelevant to the question of the CO2 greenhouse effect.  The> percentage of CO2 as a fraction of all gases in the atmosphere is an> irrelevant figure, as is the percentage of abstracts quantifying> human-caused global warming as a percentage of all abstracts captured> in our literature search.> > It's also worth noting that based on Monckton's logic, only 0.08% of> abstracts reject human-caused global warming.  [1]: http://sks.to/BaerbelW  [2]: http://sks.to/denial101x  [3]: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/meta;jsessionid=F2F0345156F3DA357E15563FBA761282.c1  [4]: http://skepticalscience.com/debunking-climate-consensus-denial.html  [5]: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-013-9647-9  [6]: http://www.webcitation.org/6JN1aQuCL  [7]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZSPOawk698  [8]: http://skepticalscience.com/debunking-climate-consensus-denial.html#quantification  [9]: http://skepticalscience.com/debunking-climate-consensus-denial.html#Cat17"

His co-author for the article - [Roy Spencer][4] - should really know better but doesn't. Here are the first three paragraphs from Dana's article (to see all the links, check out the Guardian post):> Rupert Murdochâ€™s The Wall Street Journal editorial page has long> published op-eds denying basic climate science. This week, they> published an editorial denying the 97% expert scientific consensus> that humans are causing global warming. The editorial may have been> published as a damage control effort in the wake of John Oliverâ€™s> brilliant and hilarious global warming debate viral video, which has> now surpassed 3 million views. After all, fossil fuel interests and> Republican political strategists have been waging a campaign to> obscure public awareness of the expert consensus on global warming for> nearly three decades.> > The Wall Street Journal editorial was written by Joseph Bast,> president of the Heartland Institute political advocacy group of> Unabomber billboard infamy, and Roy Spencer of â€œglobal warming Nazisâ€ù> infamy. Spencer previously claimed in testimony to US Congress to be> part of the 97% consensus, although his research actually falls within> the less than 3% fringe minority of papers that minimize or reject the> human influence on global warming.> > Spencerâ€™s claim to the contrary was a result of failing to understand> the consensus research he referenced. In The Wall Street Journal this> week, Spencer and Bast continued that tradition of misunderstanding> and misrepresenting the scientific literature on the expert global> warming consensus.Regardless of what you'd like to believe, the [Cook et al. (2013) 97% consensus result is robust][5].Instead of relying on 3rd partys misrepresenting our study (I'm a co-author), you should perhaps read [the paper][6] and check out [the additional information][7] we have at Skeptical Science about it.

I haven't the time or willingness to try to independently evaluate your research.  I saw Monckton's relevant presentation on youtube of the Heartland conference. He was upfront about  two-thirds of  the papers not talking a position.  I think his low-ball of your estimates was made for effect rather than deception.  After all your results are usually  communicated as ""97% of climate scientists agree ..."" rather than the more accurate ""97% of climate scientists who bothered to express an opinion (and most don't express an opinion) ...""If you want to know individual scientists' opinions I don't know why you simply don't ask and compile a list.  Ask ""Is Global Warming a Crises? - why or why not"" or ask ""What is the most probable value for ECS?""."

Actually I work in IT and - as shown in e.g. my [edX-profile][1] - I help at Skeptical Science in my spare time.Did you read our paper? If you did, you'd know that the abstract-rating the Skeptical Science team did represents only half of the results. The second half is where we actually invited the authors of the studies in our large sample to evaluate their own papers. In order to do that, we had sent emails to about 8.500 authors (those we could find email-addresses for). Among all papers that were self-rated as expressing a position on human-caused warming, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. This result is consistent with our abstract ratings, which found a 97.1% consensus.What is really interesting is, that - AFAIK - all the attacks on our study studiously ignore that immediate replication via the self-ratings. I wonder why that is? Could it be, that it's easier to just cherry-pick and then misrepresent our abstract-ratings and ignore the corroborating self-ratings?For more details, see [here][2].So, you see, we basically already did what you are asking for. As did some of the other consensus-studies mentioned in your ""[consensus view][3]"" thread. If you think other questions should be asked, you could go ahead and devise your own study, put a team together and get going. This could however turn into quite a time-consuming endeavour - I know how long it took us to do Cook et al (2013)!If you read attacks on the scientific consensus, you'll notice that they all share all or at least some of [the 5 Characterstics of consensus denial][4].Hope this helps.  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/u/BaerbelW  [2]: http://skepticalscience.com/tcp.php?t=faq#check  [3]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+Climate101x+3T2015/discussion/forum/8c12e4419027d4cc7b13d548a6441fe10c2b31e3/threads/561e8bb1c7627775b2000633  [4]: http://skepticalscience.com/5-characteristics-consensus-denial.html"

I have. It's not that long. I have also read Legates et al. (2015). The WSJ article was simply a good starting point. And discrediting the WSJ and the authors is pretty hypocritical when you refer to two extreme leftist papers yourself, the Guardian and the even worse Salon.The Guardian article is a perfect example of smearing. The first three paragraphs as you quoted clearly shows this. It's a typical thing of the Guardian to use ad hominem arguments/fallacies and genetic fallacies, when they write about something they don't agree with. The relevant core point in the Guardian article can be summed up with this paragraph (the fifth):> ""He compared only papers that explicitly quantified the human> contribution to global warming to the full sample of all peer-reviewed> papers that mention the phrases â€œglobal warmingâ€ù or â€œglobal climate> change.â€ùYes and no. Shortly speaking, Legates et al. has more strict definitions of when someone/some article supports the idea of significant antropogenic global warming. And for a good reason; see page 300-308. Terms like ""global warming"" or ""climate change"" is really not that un-ambigious. E.g. I don't deny that there's climate change, but I deny that humans are significantly altering the state of the enviroments due to CO2 emmisions.Another point is the Guardian article which writes that the journal Legates et al. use is ""[...]an obscure off-topic journal[...]"". Really? Was that neccessary? And is it even true? Why would anyone called a scientific paper from a well respected publishing house, off-topic and obscure? It's definitely not off-topic, and I don't even know what is meant with obscure, since I read the article easily. But if you really feel like responding to Legates et al., why do so in a leftist biased newspaper, and not in a scientific journal?But returning to Cook et al., I see several problems, where most of them are addressed by Legates et al. But here's a few of my own thoughts:First, the paper itself admits that two-thirds actually have no opinion on antropogenic global warming. Using this statistic and saying that 97% of scientists approve of the idea of significant global warming, is like saying that everyone want bananas, when twelve people have nothing in their hands, five have bananas in their hands and one has an apple in his hand.Second, I see there were difficulties in counting/assessing the abstracts, which needed three iterations, the last of them ""[...]resolved by a third party."".Third, a less than 14% response rate for self-ratings is not really useful.Fourth, counting abstracts is not the same as counting personal opinions. Authors can have several abstracts counted, i.e. count as two or more, instead of just one.Fifth, one study is simply not enough to conclude anything. Type 1 and 2 errors exist. And lastly, the idea of consensus in science is not really that justified. There once was a consensus that the earth was flat, and was the center of the universe."

(2015) is writing (and what Walter above also points out). The definition of the terms ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" are ambigous. Let's take ""climate change""; which can mean (1) the climate is changing naturally, not counting green house gases, (2) the climate is changing because of natural green house gases, (3) the climate is changing with the ""help"" of manmade CO2 emmissions, albeit only minimally and insignificantly, (4) the climate is changing is because of manmade emissions, which is significant, but not pressing matters and (5) the climate is changing because of manmade emissions, which is significant and extremely pressing. Simply speaking, just because a respondent in your survey had the opinion that ""endorse AGW"", doesn't mean that it's a pressing matter, or even important/noteworthy. This is more clearly covered in Legates et al. (2015:300-308).Second, yes, you had some authors re-confirm their abstracts and their position on AGW. But that doesn't really say much, because using voluntary/non-random surveys is really unreliable, and there was less than a 14% respense rate, which is pretty bad. If I remember correctly, the standard minimum is 50%. It doesn't really matter how many responded when the survey is invalid (as in scientific/logical validity); there was a huge survey once, asking people who would be the next US president, and the number of respondents were extremely massive, millions if I remember correctly. The survey concluded the wrong president; why? Because the survey was not based on a random sample, but only on respondents who felt hard enough to answer. This gives a huge bias, and then you can gather as many millions of respondents as you like, it's still biased. Cook et al. suffers from the same problem.Third, even if we disregard the immidiate above, the self-ratings really only confirm the categories you set in (1), and still suffer from the ambigous definitions.""Hope this helps."""

But if you want to show that CO2 levels cause warming, then you need to find a spurious effect, i.e. a third variable effecting both ocean warming and CO2 levels.Fact is that warming precedes CO2 levels, regarding these ice cores. The politician Al Gore vehemently stated otherwise in his An Inconvenient Truth, but data shows that CO2 levels lag behind with 800, as you write yourself. It's important to remember that it was Al Gore who really started the whole discussion of this lag in the public, and got it blatantly wrong.A denialist proposal is that the sun (or another great factor) is causing the initial warmup for these 800, which CO2 levels can't account for. After that, the idea is that the CO2 *can* cause the other warming after the 800 years.That proposal is not really that helpful since that if the sun can affect the first 800 years, then it's highly probable that the sun can affect the years after too, not just CO2.

As we've described in ""Improving this Course"" (under About Climate Change: The Science, on the left panel in the Courseware tab), we're trying to figure out how we can provide the best learning experience for a community that is highly diverse and has a wide variety of backgrounds and interests.  So, as noted on the Assignments page, the assignments are slightly different - if you're taking the course with a friend, you might see a slightly different assignment from your friend (or you might see the same assignment).  The groups are randomly assigned by edX.  In the discussion forums, for posts about the assignments, you'll see the discussion about the assignments for your group, which will be about your specific assignment.  Hope this helps, and I hope you find the assignments worthwhile.Sara Harris"

The definitions of what that consensus might mean vary widely from ""the climate warmed and some of that warming is anthropogenic (but no big deal)"" to ""the warming will be catastrophic and humans are almost entirely to blame and something must be done now (a very big deal)"".  So far, in this course, the defined consensus is the former weak (trivial) consensus, which I as a skeptic agree with (hence it is trivial).I would actually like a list of scientists who are willing to put their professional reputations on the line so that in another 20 to 30 years, if the earth has not warmed, or not warmed much we can look back and clearly see who was pushing us into wasting trillions of dollars on remediation efforts.  The politicians will blame the scientists, but most scientists don't express an opinion they just do science. Can you come up with 50 scientists who would be at #5 in the Lukan27 list and express this explicitly?  Then do they explain why, what evidence convinces them?Especially since the science became politicized, I find surveys to be of little value. It often just indicates what side of the political aisle someone is on.  I would be interested in the scientific rationale behind the strong beliefs."

Does the Cook data support this assertion? I don't see how.  At a minimum, 2/3 of the scientists were silent on the issue, only a tiny fraction of the remaining opinions explicilty expressed ""urgency"".  So Kerry is making a distortion for political purposes. To paraphrase the Princess Bride ""I do think this 97% means what [Kerry] think it means""Of course I get frustrated by these debates by dueling editorials in arguably mutually biased sources. I'd rather see the protagonists go head to, but it is the warmist left that refuses to be debate. they occaisionally trot out Bill Nye.In a similar vein I note that skeptical websites often link to their warmist counterparts. For example wattsupwiththat.com links to skepticalscience (albeit with a disclaimer).  Last time I checked this is not reciprocated.The suppression of open discussion seems to be one way. Michael Mann sues Mark Steyn (Steyn's comments on this suit at Heartland are absolutely hysterically funny: http://www.c-span.org/video/?326526-1/mark-steyn-climate-change).

This course also presented the ice core graph, but left the cause/effect relationship undiscussed.

If you're working your way through the Assignment 1 pages, the map page is right after ""How to Use the Rubric"".  Then the next page after the map is the edX assignment submission page.

I am a scientist. I am interested in the objective truth. I do not think think science should be done on the basis of opinion polls, but the 97% argument seems to be the strongest arrow in the warmist quiver and so it is worth exploring.I linked to a document that shows 1000 scientists willing to go on record with anti-CAGW positions. If the 97% held true it should be possible to produce a similar document with 30,000 pro-CAGW scientists. I asked if even 50 existed. So far the answer seems to be NO. I have been searching and asking this question for a long time and have yet to get a positive response. To me, that speaks volumes.The best counter argument, so far, has been to list the institutions that have made a climate change statement. But this presupposes that these statements by the institution's leadership are representative of the membership. I think they are not. Case in point, the APS - American Physical Society, the major professional  organization of U.S. physicists.  They issued a pro-CAGW statement without polling the membership (which they could have easily done).  There was a backlash led by Will Happer at Princeton U. There was a new revised statement suggested and this time comments from the membership were solicited (but themembership was still not polled). And, as an APS member myself, that is the last I know. Does the APS statement represent my position? - Absolutely not. Does it represent the position of the membership? Don't know, they weren't asked."

I strenuously disagree. I assume you would similarly characterize judithcurry.com, climateaudit.org and joannenova.com.au as pseudoscientific.  I started as a neutral observer and the fact they were willing to link you (skepticalscience or realclimate or climateprogress),  but you did not link to them influenced my opinion. It has been my observation throughout life that those who eschew debate usually have the weaker arguments.Anthony Watts (wattsupwiththat.com) surface stations project (surfacestations.org) seemed to me to be classic grunt work science. I find the articles posted on his site to vary widely in quality, but there are many good ones. Most important to me is the willingness to engage in debate and not censor comments.In the aftermath of the first Mann hockey stick paper, I first found climateaudit.org. I grew up with the existence of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA), being about as unquestioned consensus science as you can have in the area of paleoclimate. Then the Mann paper says no. It says global temperatures were flat from 1000 till 1950 and then they skyrocket (hockeystick). Such a paradigm shifting paper should be subjected to a great deal of scrutiny. But it wasn't. Instead it became the poster-boy both for An Inconvenient Truth and the third IPCC assessment report (AR3). Mann, a newly minted Ph.D. became a lead author for AR3. It was then I realized how politicized the science had become. In contrast, Steve McIntyre at climateaudit, was methodical in his takedown of Mann.  When he made a point he released data and R-code. In the meantime it took years to get a complete picture of Mann's methodology. In my opinion Mann's methodology was deeply flawed.Now jump ahead to the release of AR5. Is the hockeystick mentioned? I can't find it. Seems it has been quietly disappeared. In Mann's lawsuit against Steyn, where are the defenders of Mann?  Multiple amici briefs filed on behalf of Steyn (by many major media outlets: http://www.steynonline.com/6565/the-lonesomest-mann-in-town). None filed on behalf of Mann."

I don't know about the specific material you read in your research for assignment 1 but higher summer heat and changing rainfall patterns certainly are/will be impacts of climate change in many parts of the world. Having said that, you should not automatically assume that all changes in your local weather conditions/seasonal cycles are due to climate change. Make sure that in your assignment submission, you can explain how the impact you've chosen is related to climate change. Try to understand the major climate related stocks and flows in your example. Pick an impact that has an established connection to climate change rather than trying to decide yourself whether a phenomenon near you was caused by climate change. I'll make a couple of general comments that may help you in distinguishing climate change impacts. First, it's important to remember the distinction between weather and climate. Weather refers to the actual condition of the atmosphere in a specific place over a short period of time while climate refers to the average behaviour over a longer period of time. Climate change may change the frequency or severity of certain types of weather events but you can't attribute a single specific weather event to climate change. See, for example, the following two links for more information:https://www.skepticalscience.com/weather-forecasts-vs-climate-models-predictions.htmhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/noaa-n/climate/climate_weather.htmlOn longer time scales, the climate does exhibit natural variability but that cannot explain the global average temperature increase that has been measured over the last fifty plus years. That can only be explained by human induced greenhouse gas based warming. Human induced climate change can also alter natural cycles of weather variability. El NiÃ±o, which you mentioned, is a likely example of this. The link between the strength of El NiÃ±o and climate change is a topic of ongoing research but findings do seem to indicate that climate change will increase the frequency of extreme El NiÃ±o related effects. See for example:http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n2/full/nclimate2100.html (Peer reviewed journal paper abstract)http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/study-strengthens-link-between-el-nino-and-climate-change/I hope this information is helpful. Please reply if any of this was unclear or if you have any other questions.All the best, Patrick"

I challenged you to find 50 (though by your reckoning there should be at least 30000) scientists who will explicitly side with CAGW as a fact.

Disturbingly, scientists do not> know how much warming is required to trigger such changes to the> climate system.> > 3. The sooner we act, the lower the risk and cost. And there is much we can do.Waiting to take action will inevitably increase costs,> escalate risk, and foreclose options to address the risk. The CO2 we> produce accumulates in Earthâ€™s atmosphere for decades, centuries, and> longer. It is not like pollution from smog or wastes in our lakes and> rivers, where levels respond quickly to the effects of targeted> policies. The effects of CO2 emissions cannot be reversed from one> generation to the next until there is a large- scale, cost-effective> way to scrub carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Moreover, as> emissions continue and warming increases, the risk increases.And before I'd take lists of potentially mostly fake experts like the one produced by CFACT/Climate Depot into account, I'd first need to see who on that list doesn't have an entry in [DeSmog's extensive database][3]. Neither [CFACT][4] nor [Climate Depot][5] are known for reliable information when it comes to climate science.  [1]: http://whatweknow.aaas.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/whatweknow_website.pdf  [2]: http://whatweknow.aaas.org/get-the-facts/  [3]: http://www.desmogblog.com/global-warming-denier-database  [4]: http://www.desmogblog.com/committee-constructive-tomorrow  [5]: http://www.desmogblog.com/directory/vocabulary/4621"

So Rajoy's cousin, the scientist, couldn't find anyone to reliably predict the weather, and therefore there is no climate problem and we shouldn't rock the boat. It's a miracle he has enough brains to know how to get dressed in the morning.I can't say the same about our former Prime Minister - he was anything BUT stupid, and set about manifesting his agenda in genius ways. Because of his evil genius, Stephen Harper will go down in history as one of the worst Prime Ministers Canada has ever seen. In 2012, his Minister of Natural Resources, Joe Oliver, called Canadian environmentalists, who were exercising their due process under Canadian law, and protesting the ramming through of the Northern Gateway Pipeline development, ""Foreign funded radicals, [who were trying to subvert the economic prosperity of Canada]"". This year, the RCMP (our national police force), accidentally leaked a memo which said that Canadian environmentalists were ""terrorists"", intent upon destroying the oil and gas industry. Yup, they said it: environmentalists in Canada are radicalized terrorists. Then they passed a law, called Bill C-51, which allows the government new abilities to spy on, disrupt the lives of, and detain anyone they ""suspect"" (i.e. without due process in courts of law) of terrorism, AND/OR anyone whom they suspect of trying to ***disrupt Canada's economic interests.***So, they set a precedent, by characterizing environmental protestors as terrorists, then passed a law that allowed them to shut down any dissent, all veiled under the guise of ""protecting"" Canadians and our economy. Prime Minister elect, Justin Trudeau, voted for that law, so I admit I am skeptical that things will change, especially since Trudeau is also in favour of the TPP, a massive, multinational investor state agreement, arranged in secrecy, which has potential environmental ramifications.

After some weeks, the guy keeps drinking 3 bottles of beer per day, but he is not drunk at all, so he is again  at equilibrium, but the levels of alcohol in his body are higher than before.Hope those examples would be ok!"

[Here's][1] an article about it:To answer your question about how an 18W LED (for example) bulb can create the same light as an old 100W bulb, you have to think about the units involved. The Watt is a unit of of power, specifically, one Watt is equal to one Joule per second\begin{equation}1\,W = 1\,\frac{J}{s}.\end{equation}Recall that the Joule is a unit of energy. This means that a 100W light bulb of any type uses 100J of energy every second it's turned on. That energy comes to the bulb as electrical energy. The difference between the old incandescent bulbs and newer types such as LED is the efficiency with which that energy is converted to visible light. In an incandescent bulb, a large portion of the energy is converted to heat, with only a small fraction converted to visible light. LED bulbs convert a much higher percentage of the energy they use to visible light. The amount of visible light emitted by a lightbulb is most often measured in units of Lumens. An 18W LED lightbulb and a 100W incandescent bulb both produce about 1600 Lumens of visible light, according to [Wikipedia.][2] . This is what is meant when the packaging on an 18W LED bulb says that it is a ""100W equivalent""Patrick  [1]: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/canada-dims-the-light-on-the-incandescent-light-bulb/article22739434/  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_fluorescent_lamp#Energy_efficiency"

However, the muzzling of government scientists in Canada, and the destruction of archives and research records does has an effect on students.My friend is a secondary school physics teacher and his students tried to obtain government science data to complete some school projects, and were not allowed to communicate directly with government scientists. Instead, they were expected to endure a bureaucratic process, requiring reams of paperwork requests, which took countless months. Long story short, they couldn't complete their projects by obtaining their data that way.Many government scientists have quit, and many more rose up in open and prolonged protest, and anyone in Canada who cared took notice. I am hopeful things will improve, but the data willfully destroyed, like some mid-twentieth century book burning, is lost forever."

Where does that energy come from? And energy moving is heat so does it come from the photons?Complicated physic for a simple brain!

People can be waking up, I have hope because at least the young people I know do care, but untill everybody realises the important role science has in saving the planet we're not gonna change. Science alone does not have power, people who do, doesn't care. So I think it is very important for people to start knowing this, if most people care, there will have to be a change.

Peripherally because solutions need to be tailored to the quantitative effects of global warming and these necessarily involve the science. We do not want a trillion dollar solution to a 1 billion dollar problem. (or perhaps some of us do for purely ideological reasons)The point of my post was to expose a level of hypocrisy among some of the most vocal of the warmist voices, who urge carbon austerity for others while conspicuously consuming themselves. This is especially clear to me when the only solutions offered are wind and solar and the (IMO) far more economical solution of MSRs is ignored.  How worried about global warming can they be if they view MSRs as worse?  (or is the opposition to MSRs ideological?)Your link to ideological bias brought a smile to my face.

You're right that using a rolling average (averaging the past 365 days), if you set a new high temperature record one day, the average for the most recent 365 days would be higher than the average ending with the day before.  The question intended for you to think about the annual average for the calendar year in which the record-breaking day occurred.  In that case, a record-breaking day doesn't tell you enough to conclude that the annual average temperature has changed.  Thanks for explaining how you were thinking about it.  I'll need to reword that question!Sara Harris"

However, there is much less of it in the atmosphere. CO2 has around 400 ppm (million) while CH4 has around 1800 parts per Billion, with a B. So overall effect much less. Interestingly, because of the band saturation effect, doubling the concentration of CO2 has the same effect (in terms contribution as a greenhouse gas) as doubling the concentration of CH4.

In general, it is advisable to use data from the same source, because this avoids mixing data that may have been prepared using different protocols. so if your source of historical data (NOAA) does not have september, you should go to the previous available month in the NOAA data set (august), rather than go to a different source.

First, i couldn't find the location of the course data that you're referring to, but i think i can address your uncertainty anyways. In rough terms, the potency of a greenhouse gas is related to two categories of factors: (1) the amount of longwave radiation it absorbs and reemits (""radiative efficiency""), and (2) its average residence time in the atmosphere (""atmospheric lifetime""). In the current atmosphere, CH4 has a higher radiative efficiency than CO2, but a shorter atmospheric residence time. For this reason, comparisons between CH4 and CO2 are very sensitive to the length of time over which the greenhouse effect of a pulse of emissions (e.g. a tonne of CO2 or CH4) is calculated. The environmental defense fund source that you cited uses a time scale of 20 years for its estimate of 84x relative potency, in contrast to a time period of 100 years used by the [EPA][1] and many others to calculate the standardized ""global warming potential"" of methane at around 25-35. Neither of these time periods for comparison is more correct than the other, and they are often cited alongside each other (e.g. on [wikipedia][2]); the appropriate value depends on what specific kinds of questions are being asked. My take on the relative potency comparisons is that they are a rule of thumb, rather than a measurable physical attribute of the gases. There are so many factors in how the two different gases behave in the atmosphere (e.g. the shape of the atmospheric lifetime curve and feedbacks, the degradation of CH4 into CO2 and H20) that a precise apples-to-apples comparison of the two gases is not possible. For that reason, the role of methane in anthropogenic global warming is an area of [lively scientific inquiry][3]. Does this response help with your question? let me know if you have something to add. Colin  [1]: http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gwps.html  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global-warming_potential  [3]: http://phys.org/news/2014-04-metric-greenhouse-gases-methane-carbon.html"

A small amount is coming from the permafrost but in the future another source will be methane clathrates under the sea bed .As the surface of the permafrost melts, it decompresses the ground levels and permits the methane to escape. The thawing of the ground also permits microbes to convert organic matter to carbon dioxide and methane.Under the sea bed, as temperatures increases, the pressure of the water decreases and again, permits seepage from the gas hydrate stability zone. However this source of methane will take thousands of years to happen.The melting of the permafrost and intensive agriculture are more urgent problems and  due directly to man-made global warming.The World Meteorological Organisation produced a ""Greenhouse Gas Bulletin"" in 2013, with lots of information."

I read somewhere that high thin clouds reflect and low thick clouds act like a blanket. I suppose that the higher up the troposphere the clouds are, the more likely they are to contain ice particles which reflect. I suppose that also, by rising, they obtain more aerosol particles which can absorb some solar radiation.But from experience of weather, dark thick cloud days are always cooler. So they too must be stopping some UV radiation getting through, but perhaps also retaining IR radiation from the Earth's surface.Anybody got any clarification about the effect of clouds?"

The first, which has been> referred to as the â€œdenier's bible,â€ù was Heaven and Earth. The second,> published in late 2011, was called How To Get Expelled From School: A> guide to climate change for pupils, parents and punters.> > Plimer has been a director of numerous mining companies including> Ivanhoe Australia, a subsidiary of Bob Friedland's Ivanhoe Mines, CBH> Resources, Kefi Minerals, Silver City Minerals, Ormil Energy Ltd, TNT> Mines, Niuminco Group and Lakes Oil.> > Plimer was appointed to the boards of Roy Hill Holdings and Queensland> Coal Investments by mining magnate and climate skeptic promoter Gina> Rinehart on January 25, 2012. > > As non-executive Director and Deputy Chairman of Kefi, he owns 3.6> million shares which would be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars> in today's market. > > In an article titled â€œWhy I'd put global warming on ice,â€ù Plimer> claims that his commercial interest in mining â€œdoes not colour his> arguments, which he says are based on pure scienceâ€ù and â€œdoes not> affect the independence of his beliefs.â€ùNote: just having an entry in the database doesn't mean that everything one of the listed says or writes is wrong all the time. It's just a red flag to put you on guard and to closely check the claims made. Plimer's arguments are also very often inconsistent and we have some examples of those on a handy page at Skeptical Science:http://www.skepticalscience.com/plimervsplimer.phpNote, that most of the listed inconsistencies happen within the same book and some even just a few pages apart.Plimer is also wrong about volcanoes: http://www.skepticalscience.com/volcanoes-and-global-warming-intermediate.htmBottom line: Plimer's views on human-caused climate change / global warming can safely be ignored. The chance that he gets it right consistently is close to zero.Hope this helps!Baerbel  [1]: http://www.desmogblog.com/global-warming-denier-database"

Invasive plants are quick spreading so a patch of Japanese Stilt Grass left to itself will produce more invasive plants which in turn produces more which will keep on growing and spreading. The stock is amplifying itself.Stabilizing feedback loopA period of damp cool weather produces crops of mushrooms popping up everywhere. This encourages the local wildlife to come and eat them which in turn reduces the number stabilizing it back down.(I'm not sure that's a correct example of a stabilizing feedback loop? The stock itself has to do something to create the stabilization right?)"

Your mushroom-wildlife feedback reminds me of stabilizing feedbacks between predator and prey populations: an increase in the prey population will cause an increase in the predator population, which in turn initiates a decrease in the prey population, and so on. the [lynx-hare cycle][1] is a classic example. Regarding your question of whether ""the stock itself has to do something to create the stabilization"", my answer is ""no, and usually not."" the stock is often a passive responder to the stabilizing feedback. Neither the predator nor the prey want to be stabilized, i'm sure they would rather be amplified!... which makes me think of your mushrooms and wildlife. if the mushrooms are edible, maybe it's because they are designed to get eaten. If more wildlife eat the mushrooms and poop the mushroom spores in distant places, then the mushroom spores are being spread far and wide in a perfect mushroom-growing medium (wildlife poop). This process would increase the abundance of mushrooms, which could then increase wildlife populations. So maybe your mushroom example is actually an amplifying feedback??thanks again for the thought-provoking examples!Colin  [1]: http://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/node/3052"

It's great that you have explored the deeper etymology, though, because it helps us think about what we should really mean by the word. Sequestration generally *is* meant to indicate a process of separating out something unwanted and storing it away safely. For a while, sequestration of atmospheric CO2 by the ocean was viewed as a beneficial process that reduced the impacts of emissions on climate change. But in light of the ecological impacts of ocean acidification, the oceans don't seem like such a ""safe place"" for our anthropogenic carbon dioxide.  Maybe ""absorb"" or ""dissolve"" would be a better word than ""sequester"" when it comes to the oceans as a carbon dioxide reservoir. Thanks for this post, and for all of your many contributions to this course so far. Colin"

I am really looking forward to reading everyone's submissions on the map, so i would really encourage you to submit something even though you wouldn't get a grade for it. Doesn't need to be fancy, but it would be really cool to hear about climate change in your part of the world. Please note that we are currently in the process of fixing [a problem with the map][1], so you won't be able to upload your map submission for the next couple of days anyways. stay posted!Colin  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBCx+Climate101x+3T2015/info"

Gamma rays are very high energy: high frequency and very short wavelengths, but in fact too energetic to be visible. So it's not a question of more heat less heat, but just the right amount of heat/energy to fall within the visible spectrum."

To answer your question, yes, your assignment grade is the grade you're given by peer review---not including the points you get for posting to the climate change impacts map. The assignments are not marked by the instructor or teaching assistants. There are over 4000 students registered in this course and we simply do not have the resources to have staff mark the assignment submissions. Peer grading is a common approach in massive open online courses. It's not a perfect process but we think it provides the best method for students to get valuable feedback on their work within the resources allotted to run this course.All the best, Patrick"

Unfortunately you cannot start a review, save it, and continue the next day. Once you open another student's essay for peer review, you have eight hours to complete the review. After that time period, the essay will be passed on to another student for review. This is edX policy and not something the staff of this course can control. The purpose of the policy is to avoid a situation where a student starts a review and then forgets to finish it until after the review deadline has passed. This insures that each student has the best chance possible to have their essay reviewed. Once again, I'm sorry that your work was thrown away. We, the course staff, truly appreciate the effort that students put into the peer review process. Having assignments like we have in this course would not be possible without it.We recommend that you spend approximately 30-60 minutes per essay on peer review. Assuming you're already familiar with the rubric, this should give you time to read the essay carefully and critically and evaluate how well it meets each category in the rubric. If you'd like to spend more time to really engage with the material, maybe fact check some of the claims made in the essay, you are of course more than welcome to do so but that level of work is not expected. I hope this information is helpful. And please reply if you have any other questions about the peer review process.All the best, Patrick"

Zwally goes on to further state that the trend of increase in ice mass is slowing, and will be outdone by ice loss in X years. I mention this because a near and dear climate change denier emailed me the Zwally article, as reported in CS Monitor with a juicy title, and wrote in his email to me: ""ha, I win. Climate change is a hoax!"" After going through the article paragraph by paragraph, I was able to clearly show the opposite, but at first glance the media coverage makes this paper seem like it is leaning towards disagreeing with the consensus; it is not. It is, however, a TOTALLY useful paper to read and to understand in terms of realizing the dynamics of the climate system and how easily little nudges here and there can have knock-on effects that were unexpected, or hard to quantify via modelling alone.

It is a paper that is supporting the consensus, but it has some points of concern by some scientists.

And the question asked regarding these plots was, ""Based on these plots, which gas do you think would be the best greenhouse gas, that is, absorbs and emits the most radiation in the wavelength range of energy given off by Earth"".  The correct answer was H2O, which seems clear looking at the absorption bands.  And the band for CO2 shows it's quite effective in the 12 to 15 micron range (sorry, I don't remember the exact range).  Looking at CH4, it seems to have a very narrow absorption band somewhere down in the 6 to 7 micron range (again, just guessing at the range), and it doesn't appear that even in that range that it's fully effective for the IR emitted.   So visually, based on those plots, and knowing, as you stated, that there's much less CH4 in the atmosphere than CO2, I remain confused as to why it's considered so much more effective as a greenhouse gas.   Any additional thoughts would be appreciated. "

It helped me clarify my thoughts on the subject.I haven't written anything to submit for well over 40 years, so I was terrified. I was also surprised to see how long winded I was ( at University writing 5000 words was the norm). It was a real challenge to cut it down to 750 but a real exercise in sorting out the essentials. Unfortunately that took all the personal, light-hearted nature out of my essay and left just bare bones.Reading and reviewing was interesting, but a hard slog when there are no paragraphs! I finished up copying and pasting onto Word, putting in paragraph breaks myself, then reading the paper. I found the comments box useful, I think it's important to explain why you've given a certain grade.I certainly found the comments on my paper very useful, though sometimes contradictory.I loved reading all the other essays on the map; once the map problems were fixed. Certain contributions added points that I found very interesting and have since investigated further.However, it's possible to read the submissions without having submitted, maybe not even finished, your own. At first I thought this may lead to 'cheating', or pinching of ideas. But then I realised that that was actually positive, adding to each other sum of knowledge.So over all, well done the team, and thanks."

There's been some nice discussion! I'd just like to emphasize that the Zwally et al. paper has nothing at all to do with the question, ""is human induced climate change occuring?"" The paper acknowledges climate change as fact quite early on. The paper is concerned with measuring the mass balance of Antarctica, which has implications for how Antarctica will respond to climate change. Additionally, without wading into any controversy about the paper's findings, I want to emphasize that it does not question the consensus that West Antarctica and the Antarctic peninsula are rapidly losing ice near their margins. The question is, how is that being balanced by accumulation of snow, which will eventually be compressed into glacial ice. And one final point, this paper is solely about Antarctica. It does not change the fact that earth's other major ice sheet, in Greenland, has an extremely negative overall mass balance, meaning that it loses far more mass than it gains each year. There is no controversy surrounding Greenland's mass balance. "

In your example, CO2 initially went up, and then something (or things) occurred to cause the CO2 to go back down.Notice, though, that in your example of amplifying feedback, the initial perturbation was an increase in the Sun's intensity.  However, the condition for a feedback is *not* met here because there is not a loop that causes the Sun's intensity to increase further.What you have described is an *amplification* of the effect of warming, but *not* a feedback.  Does that make sense?For a system to experience a feedback, note that A must affect B, which then affects C, which then affects D . . . which then affects A.  (Of course, it could be just A and B, or there could be many many links in the loop.)  However many steps there are in the process, though, the final effect has to be that the final step perturbs the very first one."

If the former, then you are of course welcome to consult as many sources as you'd like but these should enrich your understanding of one of the topics presented in the assigned readings, rather than replacing them. Having said that, you're not expected to consult sources other than those listed and you don't need to present your essay in any more detail than what's presented in the readings. The readings do correspond to the assignment topic. I'm sorry if the wording was unclear. None of the readings describe the entire carbon cycle but they each describe an aspect of the cycle and its relation to climate change. One way to approach the assignment might be to choose one or two of the readings and think about how they relate to the carbon cycle. For example, are they related to the fast or slow carbon cycle? What sources or sinks of carbon do they describe? E.g. Do they describe a mechanism for carbon being released into the atmosphere or absorbed by it?  Then think about how these stocks and flows of carbon are related to climate change? For example, if a reading describes a mechanism that releases CO2 into the atmosphere, would a warming climate cause this mechanism to release more or less CO2?I hope this information helps you think about how to research and write your assignment. Please let me know if this does or doesn't help clarify things for you.All the best and happy writing, Patrick"

I think the main reason for the apparent discrepancy is that the albedo of 0.20-0.40 in your reference is for bare ice. the value for snow in that table is 0.40 (old) to 0.95 (fresh). Given that the continental glaciers of greenland and Antarctica are predominantly snowcovered, this explains the cited albedo of 0.75, which is consistent with the albedo maps that they present. But your postulation about the effect of the sun's zenith angle is interesting. In a cursory search i found a paper, [Gardner and Sharpe (2010)][1], that quantifies the effects of various factors on snow albedo. this paper indicates that solar zenith angle (deviation from vertical) is a factor that increases albedo. See figure 4 in this paper and the associated text: > Shortwave infrared albedo is also influenced by the incident> radiationâ€™s angle of incidence (Figure 4). At higher angles of> incidence a photon will, on average, travel a path that is closer to> the surface increasing its probability of experiencing a scattering> event that will send it out of the snowpack (see Figure 11 of Warren> [1982]). In addition, the effective radius of snow grains is often> smaller near the surface (where snow is younger), so photons entering> at high angles of incidence will experience more scattering events> near the surface. This is enhanced by significant  asymmetric> scattering in the near-infrared region of lambda >1.4 mm that strongly> favors scattering in the forward  direction [Aoki et al., 2000; Hudson> et al., 2006]. Nearultraviolet and visible wavelengths experience such> low  absorption that nearly all radiation at these wavelengths> eventually scatters back out of the snow regardless of angle of> incidence.So in conclusion, the main reason for the high albedo of Antarctica and Greenland is their snow cover, but if we take this paper at face value then the high incidence angles at these high latitudes is also a contributor. Thanks for posting!Colin  [1]: http://arctic.eas.ualberta.ca/downloads/Gardner%20and%20Sharp_BB%20albedo.pdf"

There are many factors that link climate change to insect reproduction and population expansion rates. here are a few off the top of my head: 1. As ectotherms, insect life cycles are directly related to temperature: the warmer it is, the shorter the life cycle. in some cases, this allows insects to complete two life cycles in a single year rather than one, before going into dormancy for the winter; 2. Warmer temperatures may improve the survival rates of larvae; 3. climate change can stress insect food sources (e.g., trees), reducing their defenses against insects and thus improving survival. Here's some general web reading on the topic: [http://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/topics/insect-disturbance][1]If you really want to dive in to an important example, check out [this great paper][2] about the interweaving factors that led to the epidemic outbreak of bark beetles in Western North America: Raffa, K.F.; Aukema, B.H.; Bentz, B.J.; Carroll, A.L.; Hicke, J.A.; Turner, M.G.; Romme, W.H. 2008.

I like the angle you took on this question, by thinking about the density of carbon as a constituent of different molecular structures.  I guess the atmosphere has the advantage of being 30km thick (troposphere only), as opposed to the centimeter to meter-thick scale of the biosphere. I can imagine how those orders of magnitude could balance out the density differences.

Cut my electricity consumption by 60%. My electricity is green sourced.I live in the middle of the country, so when I need to go shopping etc, I organise one day of ""movement"" , regrouping all my activities so that the car is only used the once. I have a very old car, so I can use 25% local sunflower oil produced by a retired farmer locally.I buy only local organic food etc. I use cotton bags, glass bottles etc to shop with: no packaging for me thanks!The very little amount of rubbish that I produce goes to the recycling bins in the village.I heat my house with wood: locally grown, cut and delivered (group buying organised by a small local association). I don't have air conditioning despite temperatures up to 40Â°C now. I open every door and window at dawn to air the house, then every shutter is closed, and every curtain pulled. Keeps the inside temperature at about 25Â°C which is liveable with.I don't have a WC! I have a compost toilet. The compost is used after 2 or 3 years on the garden. I never bath, I only shower. The water is heated instantly, only the water I use. The grey water from the kitchen and bathroom go directly to irrigate the vegetable garden.I cook with ""Waterless"" pans, which means I use 70% less gas than I used to.  I'm vegetarian.With friends, we publish a free local organic produce guide so that other people can buy directly from the producers. We man information stands at public events; about climate and organic food. We help organise a Village of Alternatives each year to show people that there are alternatives!  And we support other groups financially: 'NO GMO', 'Energy Transition', 'No Shale Gas' and 'Local Community Garden Project'. We are organising the mobilisation of the public for the COP21 at the moment.And finally, I work as a volunteer for an international humanitarian group, looking after asylum seekers and refugees. In order to make sure I don't use the car more than once a week, I bring a lot of the work home with me (admin. and accounts stuff). I'm organising a visit from a co-operative of organic peasant growers from El Salvador, that we helped set up a few years ago. All my clothes come from our second hand clothing shop.Don't worry if this seems like a lot: I made a conscious decision to change my life a few years ago, and now I'm retired,  I can be busy in lots of useful ways. Never a dull moment."

The key observation is that the trends in these two gases behave differently in the past several thousand years than would be expected.  The expectation, given Earth's orbital cycles and observations from previous natural climate cycles is that both these gases would decrease in atmospheric concentration, but they both increase instead.  Your intuition that early humans would not have had the capability to change the composition of the atmosphere is exactly why these results are surprising! And you're right - the early increase in these atmosphere gases is at a much slower rate than our past 150 years.Sara Harris"

We have been troubleshooting your issue with edX. they have looked at your specific submission history and this is their assessment: > It does seem like the student is trying (and failing) to review the same essay repeatedly, rather than receiving and reviewing the same assignment multiple times. The no entry under ""Peer assessments completed by this student"" is strongly suggestive of this. For background, a student cannot change which essay they are reviewing by closing the browser - they are 'locked in' to that essay until they review it, or until an unspecified amount of time has passed.I'd recommend the student retries submission (some assignments require all fields, such as the comment boxes, to be filled), and contact our student support team at technical@edx.org if they continue to have difficulties.Given that you successfully navigated the peer review process for assignment #1, I'm thinking that this is more likely a bug rather than an error on your part. Nevertheless, the most direct way to test this is to re-do your peer assessment for this paper. For what it's worth, i'll recommend making sure you are pressing the ""submit"" button rather than the ""save"" button. I'm very sorry that it is taking so long to resolve this, and for the extra effort it is taking on your part.

I'm not sure I understand your question. Are you asking about the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle? Or about the role of water (H20) in photosynthesis? Photosynthesis does require water. From one of the course readings http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/CarbonCycle/page3.phpwe see that a basic chemical reaction describing photosynthesis isCO2 + H2O + energy = CH2O + O2.So in order for photosynthesis to occur, energy from the sun, CO2, and H2O must all be present. If a plant runs out of water it will not be able to perform photosynthesis. Does this answer your question or have I misunderstood?Sincerely, Patrick"

There has been a lot of criticism of scientific writing for its opacity. The IPCC reports have been voted the least understandable document in the public domain! However, I think this is rather unfair. Scientists are used to writing for other scientists and not for a general public. But there do appear to be cultural traditions, citations or numbered points to reference, for example.For non scientific audiences, citations need to be either  explained or serve as an explanation, but since they are often in scientific language, they can create a block to understanding.Is it fair to ask scientists to write for the general public or should we rely on scientifically competent journalists?  Should scientists be given creative writing lessons? As a member of the public, I  found that those that teach are better at communicating to a wider audience, but not all of them. If we want the world to understand the climate situation, communication is a very relevant point."

It doesn't appear therefore that they keep a stock of carbon just in case for **future** photosynthesis. That CH2O is in their biomass. Trees, because they grow for a long time and are big, have a large biomass and therefore have a large stock of carbon. Vegetables are small , have a very short lifespan in comparison to trees, and therefore have a small stock of carbon. They are both susceptible to temperature change: there is an upper limit at which metabolic processes cease. They cannot photosynthesise above a certain temperature (varies for each plant). So no matter how much CO2 and H2O they have, they die! We have an example with the wine industry at the moment. The temperatures haven't reached destructive levels, but they are changing the sugar content of the grapes, which is making the wine more alcoholic! However, as the temperatures are increasing, certain regions of the world know that their wine industry will be finished by 2050. This is the case for Bordeaux, where I live. They are trying to develop more heat resistant plants, but of course the wine will not taste the same; therefore a whole industry is under threat.So if you are a wine lover, I suggest you start to stock up now with our Grand Cru.

As temperature increases you get more saturation vapour pressure. In other words, to saturate cold air you need to add more water vapour and to saturate warm humid air you need to cool it down. I know that a cloud droplet is very small (~0.05 mm), a drizzle drop a bigger (~0.5mm)  and a raindrop enormous (~2mm).I also have read that to form a droplet there needs to be a small particle of ""dust"". I presume that fog must have roughly the same size droplets as clouds? But what makes one get bigger and become another, I'm not sure, presumably the temperature.So perhaps where you live the temperature is too warm for the fog to become rain. Does it rain the other side of the mountains? Or is the air too dry?You've encouraged me to delve further into this, so thanks, and good luck with your research."

Just be sure to be patient... the map takes a few seconds to load once you have selected the outputs you want. But maybe what you are looking for is a summary of the assumed emissions of different countries.  This should be possible becuase the RCPs are spatially explicit, but i'm not aware of any summaries.

About further education, there are now lots of other free, open, online courses that address some aspect of climate change, each with different approaches/perspectives/goals.  I haven't done a comprehensive review, but I'd recommend two (and I'm sure there are others that are excellent).  One of the two is David Archer's ""Modeling Climate Change"" on edX, which is currently available in self-paced mode ([https://www.edx.org/course/modeling-climate-change-uchicagox-ps280x][1]).  This one would be good if you enjoy playing with models and want to learn more about how climate models work.  David Archer has a suite of interactive simulations that help make visible the impacts of changes to the atmosphere.  Definitely more advanced than this course.  The other is ""Making Sense of Climate Denial"" by John Cook and others, also on edX ([https://www.edx.org/course/making-sense-climate-science-denial-uqx-denial101x-0][2]). This one has climate science content, but its focus is on communication, which is such a critically important issue now.  For further climate science knowledge, I'd also highly recommend their website [skepticalscience.com][3].  It is excellent.  About getting involved (or changing careers - a much bigger step than getting involved!), I'd take a look around your town, city, county, state, province and see what kinds of decisions about energy are being made these days, by whom, and how you might participate in influencing those decisions.  (For example, around here, there are major decisions pending about whether to build the long-term infrastructure to export fossil fuels from Canada to markets in Asia). Or, if you are in business, whether some aspect of your business could be changed to have a positive impact on mitigation efforts (reducing carbon emissions).  Or, if you are in education, whether your curriculum could change to better infuse climate issues throughout.  And, of course, this is a critical time for governments to make major decisions about commitments to decrease carbon emissions and it turns out to be very important who is in power - so there's always politics! Let us know how it goes, and good luck!Sara Harris   [1]: https://www.edx.org/course/modeling-climate-change-uchicagox-ps280x  [2]: https://www.edx.org/course/making-sense-climate-science-denial-uqx-denial101x-0  [3]: http://skepticalscience.com/"
