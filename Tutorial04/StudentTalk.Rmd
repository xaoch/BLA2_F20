# Analyzing Student Discussion

This tutorial will guide through the analysis and reporting of students' online discussion.

For this tutorial we will use a dataset from a MOOC on Climate Change.  The raw data file can be <a href="">downloaded here</a>.

Let's load this dataset and see what is in it.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
